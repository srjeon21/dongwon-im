## A Webpage for Dongwon Internal Medicine Clinic

This is a responsive website built to be used as a homepage for my motherâ€™s hospital. Dongwon Internal Medicine is the name of the clinic where my mom works as a doctor. It is a personal project that I proceeded with the wish of using my field to support my family.
It was my first time developing a webpage for an actual client; throughout this project, I frequently interacted with my mom so that I could achieve her needs. That way, I became a better communicator, which is one of the most important characteristics for a developer.
This project also helped me become more advanced in HTML and CSS, including a map insertion, a fixed navigation bar, and a smooth-scrolling animation.
I would continue working on the website for maintenance, as well as for enhancement whenever I learn a new tool.
